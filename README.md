## Project Overview:
This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the Tokyo Olympics medal data. The dashboard allows users to explore medals by type (gold, silver, bronze), distributions across regions, medal combinations, rankings, and more.

## Project Structure:
- **[Datasets Folder](./Datasets/)**: Contains source data files (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- **[Scripts Folder](./Scripts/)**: Power Query M and DAX scripts used for data transformation and analysis.
- **[Reports Folder](./Reports/)**: Power BI (.pbix) files with the completed dashboards.
- **[Documentation Folder](./Documentation/)**: Detailed project overview, analysis, and steps (Markdown files).

## Project Goals:
- Create an interactive Power BI report summarizing the Tokyo Olympics medals by type and country.
- Visualize medal rankings, percentage of total medals, and various medal combinations across countries.

## Data Sources:
- **Tokyo Olympic Medal Data**: The source data for medals was downloaded from a public dataset available online.
- **Country-Region Data**: Manually compiled and corrected data on country names and regions. "Great Britain" was replaced with "United Kingdom" for map compatibility.
